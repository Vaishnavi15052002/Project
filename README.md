# INTEGRATED BUS TRACKING AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
### Abstract:
This project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive Bus Tracking and
Monitoring System utilizing an Arduino microcontroller. The system is equipped with
multiple sensors to ensure the safety and efficiency of bus operations. Emission levels are
monitored to ensure compliance with environmental standards, while engine temperature is
measured to prevent overheating. Vehicle stability is detected to alert users of potential
hazards, and tire pressure is monitored to prevent accidents caused by underinflation. Realtime location tracking is enabled for effective route management. The system also detects
accidents or significant impacts, triggering immediate alerts. All data is transmitted to the
Blynk IoT platform using a Wi-Fi module, where it is visualized in real-time. In case of an
accident, the system sends instant alerts to designated users, enhancing response times and
ensuring safety. This system provides a robust solution for fleet management, enabling
continuous monitoring of critical parameters and improving overall bus operation safety and
efficiency.
